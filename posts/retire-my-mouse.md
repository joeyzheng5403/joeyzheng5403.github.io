I feel my fingers quiet hurt when I got home, especially my forefinger of right hand.
maybe it's because use the mouse too much.
so today i'm trying to retire my mouse.
this post will record some knowledge when I through the path.


## Browser
Browser is a very important software to use
finally, I find this doc, It's a personal version of chromium to use.
https://brookhong.github.io/2021/04/18/brook-build-of-chromium.html
it can use Surfingkeys in everywhere.

## The last 
keynav is the last path to retire the mouse.
