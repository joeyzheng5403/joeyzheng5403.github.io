I change from Emacs and vim so many times.
And use SpaceVim and SpaceEmacs.
Finally I start to build my own Emacs conf.
This blog will record any thing I learn how to use Emacs.

## Searching and Replacing in Multiple Files
A cool trick I learned recently is the ability to search and replace in multiple files.

1. With helm-ag you can search through all files in your projectile project with SPC / or SPC s p.
2. Enter your search query and a list of files with that occurrence will show up
3. Then hit C-c C-e and Spacemacs will create a helm-ag-edit buffer
4. Now you can use any command youâ€™d normally be able to run on a buffer. For example, a simple Vim search and replace %s/alice/bob/g.
5. Then hit C-c C-c to save the changes.
